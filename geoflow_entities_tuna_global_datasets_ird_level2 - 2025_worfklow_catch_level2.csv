id:global_catch_ird_level2_1950_2023,title:Global monthly catch of tuna and tuna-like species (%temporal_extent:start% - %temporal_extent:end%) IRD Level 2,"abstract: This dataset compiles monthly global catch data for tuna, tuna-like species and sharks from 1950 through 2023. Catches are stratified by:
  - month  
  - species  
  - gear_type ( reporting fishing_gear)  
  - fishing_fleet (reporting country)  
  - fishing_mode (type of school used)  
  - geographic_identifier (1deg or 5deg grid cell)  
  - measurement_unit i.e. unit of catch (weight or number)  
  - measurement (catch)  
  - measurement_type (landings or retained catches)  
  - measurement_processing_level (original samples or processed data)  
  - a label column is added for each field (e.g. fishing_mode, species, gear_type, etc.) to provide clear descriptive metadata  

IRD Level 2 denotes the series of processing steps applied by the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) to generate this dataset from the primary RFMO catch-and-effort data. Although some steps mirror those used in the FIRMS Level 0 product (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5745958), the entire workflow was rerun to integrate early adjustments to IATTC shark and billfish data prior to final aggregation. At the global scale, Level 2 processing includes :

- Merging RFMO catch-and-effort datasets while removing redundant strata and reassembling incomplete ones to produce the most complete catch estimate per stratum.  
- IATTC Purse seine catch-and-effort are available in 3 separate files according to the group of species: tuna, billfishes, sharks. This is due to the fact that PS data is collected from 2 sources: observer and fishing vessel logbooks. Observer records are used when available, and for unobserved trips logbooks are used. Both sources collect tuna data but only observers collect shark and billfish data. As an example, a strata may have observer effort and the number of sets from the observed trips would be counted for tuna and shark and billfish. But there may have also been logbook data for unobserved sets in the same strata so the tuna catch and number of sets for a cell would be added. This would make a higher total number of sets for tuna catch than shark or billfish. Efforts in the billfish and shark datasets might hence represent only a proportion of the total effort allocated in some strata since it is the observed effort, i.e. for which there was an observer onboard. As a result, catch in the billfish and shark datasets might represent only a proportion of the total catch allocated in some strata. Hence, shark and billfish catch were raised to the fishing effort reported in the tuna dataset.
- Retaining weight measurements and converting counts to weight using matching strata from nominal datasets. A comparative analysis showed that count data often cover a broader spatial footprint than weight data, so raising factors were applied to convert counts to tons—preserving maximal spatial detail.  
- Expanding georeferenced catch records to total catch volumes based on nominal data.  
- Removing land-based or non-georeferenced catches. (Identical to FIRMS Level 0)  
- In overlapping IATTC–WCPFC zones, retaining only IATTC data (because it includes vessel-flag information). (Identical to FIRMS Level 0)  
- For Southern Bluefin Tuna, keeping solely CCSBT data and removing duplicates from other RFMOs. (Identical to FIRMS Level 0)  
- Mapping original RFMO code lists for gears, species and flags to standard FAO lists in collaboration with RFMO secretariats. (Identical to FIRMS Level 0)

info: Specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account : In addition to each tuna RFMO’s dataset-specific caveats, note that :  
- Georeferenced catches are raised to total volumes using strata combinations of {fishing_fleet, species, fishing_mode, year, gear_type, geographic_identifier_nom}. If a matching stratum is missing in the nominal dataset, those catches remain unraised.  
- Some catch-and-effort strata may report higher catches than the nominal dataset; in such cases, the higher value is retained.  
- Certain data may be reported at coarser temporal (>1 month).
- When nominal strata lack specific dimensions (e.g., fishing_mode always UNK) but georeferenced strata include them, the nominal data are “upgraded” to match—preventing loss of detail. Currently this adjustment aligns nominal values to georeferenced totals; future versions may apply proportional scaling.

This work aims not only to provide a biomass dataset for scientific purposes but also to identify and address data inconsistencies, improving the overall process. All code, materials, and packages used are available on the GitHub repository, firms-gta/geoflow-tunaatlas, along with detailed documentation on the impact of each specific treatment.
Warning: This dataset is designed to enhance the understanding of fish counts at level 0. It is not suitable for accurately georeferencing data by country or fishing fleet and should not be used for studies on fishing zone legality or quota management. While it offers a georeferenced footprint of captures to reflect reported biomass more closely, significant uncertainty remains regarding the precise locations of the catches._  ",,"owner:FAO-HQ@fao.org_
